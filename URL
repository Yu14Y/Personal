Currently, if you are not able to access from github pages, do not worry, as the hyperlinks i put there are for vercel deployment

although i have plans to deploy it from renderer.com as some country have firewall blocked vercel

i also have plans to clone this repo to gitlab and codeberg and bitbucket and then deploy from there also as my country have firewall blocked some github subdomain and some gitlab sub domains 

I have also heard some country do firewall block github and gitlab so codeberg and bitbucket is just an backup plan for anyone that try to visit this sites but fail
these deployment will likely be in a subdomain
